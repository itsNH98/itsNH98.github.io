## Prospective students

### PhD

Unfortunately, I am not taking any new PhD students at this time.

### MSC students already enrolled at HEC Montéal

If you are interested in working under my supervision for your MSc thesis or supervised project, please contact me by [email](mailto:vincent.3.gregoire@hec.ca?subject="Supervision"). The initial email requesting supervision for a supervised project or thesis should include the following elements:

- If it is for a thesis or supervised project, and for a supervised project if it is to be done with an industry partner.
- Expected start and completion date of your project.
- A list of topics of interest to you or potential research questions.

Note that I am often overbooked for supervision. I will either try to book a meeting with you to discuss your project further or recommend other professors in line with your topics of interest.
