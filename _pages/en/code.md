## Select Projects

- [Financial Risk Management Project](https://github.com/itsNH98/financial_risk_management) **Python, R & Matlab** The main objectives are to generate backtesting returns data to apply strategies effectively, forecast risk measures for benchmark portfolios, and assess the risk of adding new strategies to existing portfolios. Additionally, we aim to improve the tool incrementally by incorporating new advanced methodologies such as multivariate volatility forecasting, copula models, extreme value theory and machine learning.

- [Financial Econometrics Labs](https://github.com/itsNH98/financial_econometrics_labs) **Python** Labs that were developed as a showcase for adequate practice to help students complete their assignments in MATH60210. Topics covered include asset pricing models, financial time series prediction, model estimation, risk and volatility modeling, and event studies. 

- [Cryptocurrency Momentum Strategy](https://github.com/itsNH98/cryptocurrency_momentum_strategy) **Python, R** This research project presents a crypto-based trading strategy that integrates price momentum, size, and investor attention to create a robust and efficient investment approach. The foundation of the strategy is derived from the research conducted by Yang (2019), Liu (2021), and Liu (2022), which collectively support the inclusion of price momentum, size and attention in the trading framework.

- [Mixed Momentum Strategy](https://github.com/itsNH98/mixed_momentum) **Python** Based on limits to arbitrage arguments and conclusions derived from our experiments in [Alpha Decay](https://github.com/itsNH98/alpha_decay), we devise a stock trading strategy effectively based on the interaction of three signals (i) uncertainty, as proxied by firm age (Zhang, 2006) (ii) individual stock return momentum (Jegadeesh, 1993) (iii) announcement return, proxied by standardized change in earnings or abnormal returns (Zhang, 2006).

- [FF Decimals Randomization](https://github.com/itsNH98/ff_decimals_randomization) **Python** Using Chen and Zimmerman (2020) panel of clear predictors, we determine the impact of rounding errors induced by the decimals approximation implied in the construction of the Fama-French factors, on two types of asset pricing tests (Fama & French, 1992) (Fama & Macbeth, 1973). Conclusions to be determined...

- [Corporate Finance in Stata](https://github.com/itsNH98/corporate_finance) **Stata** Objective is to replicate the same important empirical corporate finance papers, but in Stata to get a working knowledge of the language. 

- [Alpha Decay](https://github.com/itsNH98/alpha_decay) **Python** We know that anomalies to the efficient market lose significance over time, and markedly so after publication. Our objective is to assess and demonstrate the existence of post-publication decay and loss of statistical of market anomalies over time.
